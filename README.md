# OpusFactorium
This is a OpusMagnum re-implementation in godot to add some factoio ideas and if they stick.

No assets are inclueded in the repo for the development assts being used are from the original games. Soon I plan on making my own assets, but as you should know, time is relative.

To OpusMagnum owners, if there is any problem with this repo, please let me know and it will be taken down immediatly.
